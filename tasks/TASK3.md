# react-tree
## Task 3
We want our component to support 2 collapse modes:
1. When collapsing a folder and expending it again, its subfolders will maintain their previous state. This means that any subfolders that were open before will stay open, and any that were closed will stay closed.
2. When collapsing a folder and expending it again, all it's subfolders will be closed

Add a flag to our component that allows us support both modes  
(You can create a separate component if you prefer to do so)
